<p align="left">If you are experiencing problems, here are some things you can try:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Symptom:</strong> The system crashes and prints&quot;Fatal: os::commit_memory failed&quot; in the ConsoleOutputStream window.<p>This is usually caused by filling up object Space so much that the OS cannot allocate more memory for objects. This may be because you needed to run a garbage collection before object Space grew to this point. This can happen right now because the full garbage collector does not run automatically in the implementation right now, unfortunately. It can be invoked from the UI from the&quot;System/Object Memory/Collect Garbage&quot; menu item on the launcher, or programmatically by calling&quot;VM collectGarbage&quot;.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Symptom: </strong>The system crashes and prints&quot;Fatal: cannot allocate enough Space for NativeMethod&quot;.<p>This happens when the system runs out of Space for compiled code, which is held in a memory area whose size is fixed at system startup. You can change the size of this area by changing the CodeSize parameter in the Strongtalk startup options file, <a doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a>. The code size is specified in kilobytes. 6000kb is usually plenty big enough. The startup options do not take effect until the next session.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Symptom: </strong>The user interface locks up, but the program does not crash.<p>This error has been seen in the past due to some unknown bug, probably a deadlock of some kind in the UI. We think that this bug has been eliminated, but if you encounter it, it often clears up on its own if you wait a bit or move the mouse over the window and other windows, and then try clicking a few times on various windows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other kinds of system crashes (other than stack overflows) usually are caused by some other bug in the native code compiler, which have not all been worked out. These are often hard to reproduce, so just trying the operation again after restarting may work. If it happens repeatedly and you need to make the system more stable, you can try the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, try increasing the compilation threshold. This controls how performance-critical a piece of code needs to be before the compiler tries to compile it. The value is set by the InvocationCounterLimit option in the<a doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a> startup options file. The default value is 10000; increasing this should make the system more stable by compiling less code. If you have trouble, try raising the value to 15000 or 20000. You can even raise it to a value like 50000 and the system should work fine. The startup options do not take effect until the next session.</li>
    <li>If the system still crashes after raising the compilation threshold, you can try turning the compiler off altogether. You can do this during a session using the&quot;System/Compiler/Compiler Enabled&quot; menu item on the Launcher, and the system will not compile any additional methods during that session (although it may still try to recompile existing compiled methods). You can <em>completely</em> eliminate compilation by changing the +UseRecompilation flag in the <a doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a> startup file to -UseRecompilation, which will cause the system to run using only the interpreter, which is much more stable (but obviously slower). The startup options do not take effect until the next session.</li>
</ul>
