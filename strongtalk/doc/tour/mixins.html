<h2 align="left">Mixins</h2>
<p align="left">The Strongtalk system supports a simple, elegant alternative to multiple-inheritance, called a <em>mixin</em>. This is not to be confused with the mixins of the Lisp world. Mixins are very easy to understand, and do not suffer from the tricky conflict resolution issues involved in multiple-inheritance schemes. A full discussion is not possible here, but we can look at the basic idea and a simple example.</p>
<p align="left">Basically, a mixin is what you get if you take a class, and turn it into a function that takes the superclass as an argument. When you <em>invoke</em>the mixin with a class S as its argument, it acts like a factory to produce a new class that has the methods of the original class, but which has S as its superclass.</p>
<p align="left">Let's take <a DOIT=" (ClassOutliner for: (ClassMirror on: Magnitude)) launch">Magnitude</a> as an example. Magnitude is a normal class that is a subclass of Object. It implements the comparison operators, (&lt;=, &gt;, etc) in terms of the single operator &lt;. In most Smalltalk systems, if you want to create a class that is a Magnitude, you make it a subclass of Magnitude. But if your class is already a subclass of some other class, you can't do that, because Smalltalk doesn't have multiple inheritance. </p>
<p align="left">A classic example of this situation occurs with strings. Strings are already part of the Collection hierarchy, so they can't inherit from Magnitude (Collections in general are not Magnitudes). So in most Smalltalks, strings have to reimplement all the comparison operators. In Strongtalk, the class involved is the read-only string class, <a DOIT=" (ClassOutliner for: (ClassMirror on: ReadString)) launch">ReadString</a>.</p>
<p align="left">But in Strongtalk, we can turn any class into a mixin, and then invoke that mixin with some other superclass to produce a new class. If we say &quot;Magnitude mixin&quot; the class will return a mixin that contains all the methods from Magnitude, but which needs you to supply a superclass. You supply the superclass by <em>invoking</em>the mixin using the |&gt; operator, which takes the desired superclass as the argument. In the case of ReadString, which inherits from SequenceableCollection, we build the new superclass for ReadString using the expression &quot;Magnitude mixin |&gt;SequenceableCollection&quot;, which produces a new (anonymous) class with all the Magnitude methods that inherits from SequenceableCollection. Then we just use that class as the superclass for ReadString, and we are all done.</p>
<p align="left">There is more to mixins than this, but this example gives the basic idea. Inside the Strongtalk VM, all classes are actually implemented using mixins. To learn more about mixins, look <a href="../mixins/index.html">here</a>.</p>
