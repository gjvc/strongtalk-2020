<h4 align="left">Finishing the Project</h4>

<p align="left">To finish our little project, we need to add a
'forward' button to the toolbar that calls the method that we've
written. I've already created an icon for the button. Copy,
paste, and accept the following method into HTMLView:</p>

<p align="center"><smappl visual=" ((CodeView forString) 
	doneBlock: [ :saveFlag :action | ];
	model: 
'forwardButton ^&lt;Button&gt;

	^Button
		withImage:
			(Image fromFile: (FilePath for: ''resources/goForward.bmp''))
		action: [ :b &lt;Button&gt; | 
						self goForwardOrIfAbsent: [] ]'
) embeddedVisual with3DBorder withBorder: (Border standard3DRaised: true)"> </p>

<p align="left">Now, all that is remaining is for you to go to
the #toolBar method (in the <em>toolbar</em> category), and add
this button to the toolbar. To do this, insert the line 'add:
self forwardButton;' right after the line that says 'add: self
refreshButton;'. Accept and typecheck that change, and you should
be done. To be sure you have really done everything right, you
might want to typecheck the whole class- you can do this by
choosing &quot;Typecheck entire class&quot; from the
&quot;Typechecking&quot; pull-down menu.</p>

<p align="left">Now you should be done. To see the forward button
in action, you can use the <smappl visual="Button
		withImage:
			(Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/clone.bmp'))
		action: [ :b &lt;Button&gt; |  ]
"> button to create a clone of the
browser window. The new window should have the forward button!
Test it a little, and if it works, save the system (under
&quot;File&quot; on the Launcher), and you will have it in the
future.</p>
