<p align="left">Now accept the new method, and typecheck it at
the same time, by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
(or clicking &quot;Typecheck and accept&quot; from the text
context menu). Ouch! You should get a typechecking error: 'Type
of actual argument 1 (URL|Object) is not a subtype of formal
argument type URL', for the invocation of #bareModel:.
Typechecking errors appear in a list box at the bottom of the
method. Clicking on the error highlights the section of the text
where the error occurs (this is helpful when there are multiple
errors).</p>

<h4 align="left">Dealing with a Typechecking Error</h4>

<p align="left">What does the error message mean? '|' is the type
<em>union</em> operator, which means that we are either passing
in a URL <em>or</em> an Object, but the #bareModel: needs a URL
for sure. Where did this union come from? If you look at where
the argument value for #bareModel: comes from, it is apparent: it
was returned by #popNextURLOrIfAbsent:, which returns either the
next URL, <em>or</em> the value of the failBlk if the forwardURLs
list was empty. And remember, our failBlk has the default value
type of Object, so that is where &lt;URL | Object&gt; comes from.
</p>

<p align="left">So the problem is that we haven't correctly
handled the case where there are no forwardURLs. This is a common
kind of situation in Smalltalk. The way you handle it is to write
'popNextURLOrIfAbsent: [ ^failBlk value ]' instead of
'popNextURLOrIfAbsent: failBlk'. This ensures that we abort the
execution of the expression in the empty case, so that the call
to bareModel: never gets passed the result of calling the
failBlk. So try changing the method as described above, and do
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; again.</p>

<p align="left">Uh oh! We still have a type error, but a
different one: we are returning the failBlk value, which is
&lt;Object&gt;, but the method has the default return type of
&lt;Self&gt;. Therefore we <em>have</em> to return self, so
instead, you need to write: 'popNextURLOrIfAbsent: [ failBlk
value. ^self ]'. Try that- it should be accepted and typechecked
without any errors.</p>

<p align="left">This example illustrates how two common kinds of
bugs encountered with blocks are caught right away by the type
system. The most insidious aspect of these kinds of bugs in
normal Smalltalk is that they may not be caught right away during
testing, since they only occur in an exceptional case, or in a
case where the value is often not used, which is likely to be
missed by testing. And if such bugs <em>are</em> exposed during
testing, the bad value is likely to be passed somewhere else in
the system before it causes an error, making it very hard to
track down where the bug actually is. Fortunately, we now know
for certain that this method is typesafe.</p>

<p align="left">Note that unlike other strongly typed languages,
Strongtalk lets you use the typechecker incrementally, as soon as
you are ready, even on a method-by-method basis, so you can deal
with the errors while the code is fresh in your mind. This works
even if there are other typechecking errors in your class, as
long as the messages, instance variables, etc. that you are using
in the method you are writing have valid type signatures.</p>
