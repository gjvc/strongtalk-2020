<h1 align="center">A Tour of the Strongtalk System</h1><h4 align="left">David Griswold<br>May 2002</h4>
<p>Note: This tour is designed to be viewed using the Strongtalk browser, not a regular html browser, because it contains Smalltalk code.</p>
<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>
<p align="left">The Strongtalk system is a fundamental redesign of the Smalltalk-80 system. While maintaining the basic syntax and semantics of the Smalltalk-80 language, it contains significant advances in a variety of areas relative to previous Smalltalk implementations, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p align="left">a virtual machine that executes Smalltalk<em>much</em> faster than any other implementation,</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">the first workable strong, static type system for Smalltalk (use of which is completely optional and incremental, and which does not affect performance), as well as a typed &quot;Blue Book&quot; library,</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">a flyweight, glyph-based user interface that nonetheless allows integration of native widgets, and which provides automatic layout using Tex-style&quot;shrink/stretch&quot; semantics,</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">native threads with both synchronous and asynchronous (non-blocking) C callouts, and</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">an advanced, outliner-based programming environment</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">use of mixins to provide a simple, elegant alternative to multiple inheritance</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This document is designed as a tour of the unique aspects of the Strongtalk system for researchers and serious Smalltalkers, so it assumes a solid understanding of Smalltalk systems and their architecture. It gives just enough tutorial information so that you can browse around the system, and otherwise dives right into cool nitty-gritty stuff.</p><h4 align="left">How the Strongtalk System Came About</h4>
<p align="left">The system is based on many years of work by a variety of people, starting with pioneering research done by the Self group at Sun Microsystem's Labs as well as at Horizon Technologies, Inc.. The current system was developed in secret at a small startup company, Animorphic Systems (officially LongView Technologies, Inc.), that was started in 1994. Unfortunately for Strongtalk, the rapid and unexpected (by anyone, I think) rise of Sun Microsystem's Java forced Animorphic to halt work on the Strongtalk system before it was ever released. Animorphic was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1997, and parts of the Animorphic virtual machine technology became the core of what is currently Sun's production Java virtual machine implementation.</p>
<p align="left">Because of this history, very few people have ever gotten their hands on the Strongtalk system, although rumours have floated around about it for years. Fortunately, Sun Microsystems has recently graciously agreed to release the Strongtalk system as unsupported software, so that the research and Smalltalk communities can finally get their hands on it. The released system includes full source code for all Smalltalk source code under a Berkeley-style open source license, and a&quot;Wintel&quot; binary for the virtual machine under a free, non-commercial use license (Note that I don't work for Sun Microsystems any more, and so don't speak for them and didn't decide on that policy).</p>
<p align="left">At the point at which initial development stopped on the Strongtalk system, it was running quite nicely in pre-alpha release form. However, it was certainly not completely finished, and so of course there are a fair number of messy corners still in the system, although on the whole the system is surprisingly robust. Many of the messy corners are actually pretty easy to clean up, and I for one will be doing a bit of that. The fact that the VM allows C callouts without modification or relinking of the VM means that virtually any part of the libraries can be changed and extended. <em>All</em> user interface and I/O code is in Smalltalk.</p>
<p align="left">The Strongtalk system was developed by (in alphabetical order): Lars Bak, Gilad Bracha, Steffen Grarup, Robert Griesemer, David Griswold, and Urs Hoelzle. Special thanks to the members of the Self group for their pioneering VM research.</p>
