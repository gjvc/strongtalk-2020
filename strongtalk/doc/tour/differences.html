<h2 align="left">How does Strongtalk relate to Smalltalk-80?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Strongtalk is a true Smalltalk that also provides an optional static type system. It adheres as closely as possible to modern Smalltalk-80 syntax and semantics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">The standard method syntax is supported, with some enhancements so that type annotations are also allowed.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">Full block closure semantics are supported, with local variables allowed in any block.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">The only hard-wired messages are the critical Boolean messages, such as ifTrue:..., whileTrue, etc. Other Smalltalks also hard-wire these, as well as others that are not treated specially in Strongtalk.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">The normal mixed-mode arithmetic semantics are supported, as well as infinite precision integer arithmetic.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">The normal class/metaclass semantics are supported. However, inside the VM, all classes are actually constructed from <em>mixins</em>, which adds flexibility.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">Global and class variables are supported, but class <em>instance</em> variables are not (although we had planned to add them). Pools are not supported. Shared variables that would be in Pools in other Smalltalks are just kept in class variables and accessed via class messages in Strongtalk. This does not entail a message-send performance penalty as it would in other Smalltalks, since messages to literal classes (or self) are constant messages and can be inlined away by the Strongtalk compiler.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">Indexed instance variables support is provided for objects, bytes, and double-bytes, although they are not specified as part of the class constructor as in other Smalltalks. Instead, support for them is added to a class by <em>mixing in</em> one of several special system mixins.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">#become: is not supported. The VM represents objects with direct pointers, rather than an object table, and while this increases system performance for most objects, it would make #become: prohibitively slow. So for example Collections that need to grow hold internal Arrays, etc.</p></li>
            <li><p align="left">Blocks support #ensure:, to provide important stack-unwind protection.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The library interfaces (instance and class interface semantics as well as concrete class names) conform as closely as possible to the Smalltalk-80 libraries <em>in areas used by model code</em>. In other words, code that uses the core Collection classes and other basic data structures should be able to run virtually unchanged. User access to processes appears almost the same, with fork, Semaphores, Processor, and SharedQueues all working as expected (the system uses native threads and the libraries are designed to work with preemptive scheduling, but Processes are currently scheduled non-preemptively).</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">Although the Strongtalk VM performs many fancy optimizations, it still supports the kind of interactive program creation and modification that helps make Smalltalk so unique. The intention is to make optimizations invisible to users (except for speed, of course!). This requires an enormous amount of sophistication and infrastructure in the VM, because all the different customized and inlined versions of a method must be found and fixed up dynamically as the code changes. The programming environment is bootstrapped in the same image as the user's code, as in other Smalltalks.</p></li>
    <li><p align="left">The class hierarchy is structured somewhat differently than in Smalltalk-80. This is for two reasons: 1) the core Strongtalk classes are strongly-typed, which requires more structured inheritance relationships, and 2) Strongtalk supports <em>mixins</em>, so for example strings are able to mix-in Magnitude support, even though they are not subclasses of Magnitude (since not all Collections are Magnitudes). However, concrete class names are the same, so that for example, while Dictionary is a subclass of HashedCollection rather than Set as in Smalltalk-80, Dictionary can still be used the same way it normally would in most user code. The stream instance protocols are pretty much the same, although the stream class names and hierarchy are very different. This should not matter much as most code does not create streams directly from Stream classes, but by asking some lower-level object (a collection, a file, etc) to create the stream instead.</p></li>
