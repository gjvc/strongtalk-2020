<p align="left">Now, let's look at how the guts of a Strongtalk
class look. Press <smappl visual=" Button
				withImage: (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/publicInterface.bmp'))
				action: [ :b  |	 ]	
"> on the HTMLView class browser to show the
public interface. </p>

<p align="left">The first thing that you will see that is
different from other Smalltalk libraries is that the method
signatures shown have type annotations. Notice how much easier
this makes it to understand the interface. If you open the class
header (the first item in the outline), you will see that the
instance variables have types, too (and you can imbed comments in
the instance variable string, as well). As you can see, type
annotations are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;...&gt;); method
return types are preceded by a hat (^). You will get a quick
tutorial on the type system later, so don't worry too much about
the exact meaning of the types right now.</p>

<p align="left">You can look at method bodies by expanding the
method or methods you are interested in. Many different
operations on methods and categories are available by
right-clicking over a category or method header to get the
context menu.</p>

<h4 align="left">A Little Project</h4>

<p align="left">To illustrate using the browsers and the type
system, we will undertake a very small project: adding a
'forward' button to the browser. I've gone ahead and added almost
all the machinery needed for this, but you will need to add two small
methods, and add one line to another method (I'll
provide the exact text to enter).  I've added an instance variable
'forwardURLs', and put some methods that manipulate it in the
category <em>private-forward</em>. If you look at the instance
variables, you can see clearly that the type of the instance
variable is &lt;OrdCltn[URL]&gt;. OrdCltn is just a convenient
alias for OrderedCollection, since it is commonly used.
Collections are generic, just like View, so we can see easily
that this is an ordered collection of URLs, which the type system
will enforce for us.</p>

<p align="left">Expand the <em>private-forward</em> category. If
you would like to see all the other places that I modified, right
click over the #forwardURLs method and select 'Senders'.</p>

<p align="left">The main thing you need to do is add the method
that is invoked when the forward command is invoked. Start by
adding a new method to the <em>private-forward</em> category, by
selecting 'New method' from the category context menu. Then,
enter the following text (you can copy and paste using
&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-V):</p>

<p align="center"><smappl visual=" ((CodeView forString) 
	doneBlock: [ :saveFlag :action | ];
	model: 'goForwardOrIfAbsent: failBlk &lt;[]&gt;

	| current &lt;URL&gt; |
	current := self model.
	self bareModel: (self popNextURLOrIfAbsent: failBlk ).
	self history addLast: current.'
) embeddedVisual with3DBorder withBorder: (Border standard3DRaised: true)"> </p>

<p align="left">This method uses the #popNextURLOrIfAbsent:
method to pop the last forward link off the forwardURLs
ordered collection, sets the model of the view to that URL, and then
pushes the previous URL onto the history list. If the forward
list is empty, the ...IfAbsent: block is invoked instead. I've
intentionally put a common kind of Smalltalk bug in this method,
to illustrate the type system. Can you see the bug?</p>

<p align="left">Note the type annotations. The argument is a
block, whose value type we don't care about, so we can just use
&lt;[]&gt; to indicate a block that takes no arguments and
produces an Object, by default. We haven't declared a return type
for the method, so it defaults to a return type of &lt;Self&gt;,
which we could have explicitly written by writing '^&lt;Self&gt;'
at the end of the method signature.</p>
