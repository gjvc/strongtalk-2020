<h2 align="left">How Strongtalk relates to Smalltalk-80 (cont.)</h2>
<p align="left">In areas of the library not normally used by model code (i.e. user interface, reflection, file reification, portability framework, image management, etc), we decided to feel completely free to innovate, so these areas are much different:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="left"><strong>UI</strong>: The user-interface is designed to allow much more finely-grained widgets, with full support for imbedding native widgets. For example, the line of text you are reading is actually a general GlyphRow full of individual CharacterGlyph widgets that draw themselves. Here is a real, live, embedded MS-Windows button, to show that any widget, including native ones, can be put anywhere:
            <smappl visual=" Button labeled: 'Press Me!' action: [ :b  | b	promptOk: 'The UI can do native things easily, through a portable interface.' title: 'It works!' type: #info action: [] ]">
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Reflection</strong>: Reflection is done with <em>mirrors</em>(a concept borrowed from Self), so that the system does not have to go through an object's interface to reflect on it, as in other Smalltalks. This means that objects are free, for example, to override #class so they can closely mimic some other kind of object, and this won't break system code or inspectors, etc, since they don't use those messages.</p></li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Constructors</strong>: Because of the type system and mixins, Strongtalk must support more top-level constructs and more independent options for their constructors than other Smalltalks. For example, there are also protocols and type aliases. Also, classes and protocols can be generic or non-generic, classes can be abstract or concrete, classes need to be able to declare what protocols they support, and superclasses may have <em>mixins</em> applied to them. All of this severely strained the 'constructor message to the superclass' approach used by other Smalltalks, so a more flexible declarative constructor framework was devised. It is normally hidden by the programming environment, but it means that the file-out format is different for top-level constructs, although it still uses the same 'chunk' format as other Smalltalks.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Images</strong>: Image management is very different. This is due to observation of the problems that many new Smalltalk programmers have when they are introduced to images. The first problem is that they try to use images as an actual database for their production application data, which images are completely unsuited for. A second problem is that deploying a program as an image means that you can never quite be sure what history-dependent state got mixed in with your program. So most programmers end up always having to do extra work to build a fresh image before testing and delivery, to be sure that there isn't some state floating around the image they weren't aware of. A third problem is that objects that relate to the outside world (i.e. file editors, open file descriptors, database connections, etc) can easily end up corrupted or in the wrong state, unless complex management code is written to fix them up when an image is restored.<\p> </p>
        <p>So in practice, images are really only useful as a convenient way for developers to keep the state of their programming environment between sessions. In Strongtalk, we use an external HTML start page that can hold Strongtalk browsers and code, to fulfill this function. The image itself is <em>declarative</em>, meaning that it only contains the program declarations themselves, with no variable state. This way, delivered programs always behave predictably, and start in a state defined solely by the program code.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Portability</strong>: The Strongtalk system uses a different approach to portability than some other Smalltalks. Some other Smalltalks use a completely portable image with platform specific code pushed out into the VM. And Squeak, for example, also implements the entire VM in Smalltalk, with a later translation to C before execution. We did neither of these things. At the image level, we wanted to be able to integrate tightly with native user interface facilities, so we designed portable UI interfaces that are implemented in a platform-dependent way in Smalltalk (all UI and I/O code is written purely in Smalltalk). For the VM, we felt it was simply too risky to try to Bootstrap our VM in Smalltalk, although the idea was discussed. Strongtalk was not a research project, and we were writing a fancy optimizing compiler that had to be very fast, much more so than existing dynamic translators, in order to not cause significant pauses during compilation. So the VM is
        implemented in C++ (although the bytecode compiler is written in Smalltalk, as in other Smalltalks).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Type system</strong>: And of course, Strongtalk includes an incremental, interactive typechecker, which is integrated into the programming environment. The typechecker is completely written in Smalltalk, and does not interact with the VM at all. The libraries are almost completely annotated with types, although the extent to which typechecking of the libraries had been completed at the time development stopped varies considerably. This was primarily due to bootstrappingInProgress issues: the typechecker, for example, had to be written before it could be typechecked, and it is much harder to typecheck large bodies of code <em>after</em>they have been written. The core library, including the Blue-Book classes and the UI framework, have been extensively typechecked. The programming environment has been mostly typechecked.</li>
