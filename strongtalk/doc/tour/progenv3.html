<p align="left">Once again, note the outline format of the class.
The idea is to give the more of the feel of a direct-manipulation
environment, where each class has its own browser, and its
methods and other attributes appear in context. If you click
on the first button, next to &quot;Subclass of ...&quot;, you can
see the class header. </p>

<p align="left">Note that the superclass
is View[URL], which looks a bit different than the syntax for a normal Smalltalk class name.
To the type system, View is a <em>generic</em> class, and needs
to be parameterized by the type of the model; in this case that
is a URL. The clause in brackets is invisible to the VM, so you can ignore all this and refer to the superclass in
the untyped way if you want. But if you use the typed version,
not only can you typecheck your class, but it is a lot easier to
read, as well: anyone looking at it can see exactly what
kind of model we are dealing with.  To see the superclass chain for HTMLView,
press the
<smappl visual="
	Button
			withImage:  (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/incontext.bmp'))
			action: [ :b | 	] 
"> button on the toolbar. This opens a hierarchy browser,
which is just filtering on HTMLView, so we see its superclass
chain in a convenient form.</p>

<p>Other important buttons on the class browser toolbar are:

<ul>
    <li><smappl visual=" Button
				withImage: (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/superclass.bmp'))
				action: [ :b  |	 ]	
			"> :  Open a browser on the superclass. </li>
    <li><smappl visual=" Button
				withImage: (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/hierarchy.bmp'))
				action: [ :b  |	 ]	
			"> :  Open a browser on the subclass hierarchy (Although  
<smappl visual="
	Button
			withImage:  (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/incontext.bmp'))
			action: [ :b | 	] 
"> followed by 
<smappl visual="
	Button
			withImage:  (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/openAll.bmp'))
			action: [ :b | 	] 
"> is probably more useful, as it shows the subclasses and superclasses at the
same time).</li>
    <li><smappl visual=" Button
				withImage: (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/publicInterface.bmp'))
				action: [ :b  |	 ]	
			"> :  Expand the public interface. </li>
    <li><smappl visual=" Button
				withImage: (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/fullInterface.bmp'))
				action: [ :b  |	 ]	
			"> :  Expand the entire interface, including private methods (which are just methods
				in categories whose name contains the string 'private'). </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you have spawned a class browser on HTMLView, and then proceed to the
next page.</p>
