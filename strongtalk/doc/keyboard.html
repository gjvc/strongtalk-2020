<ul>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-O opens a browser on the declaration of the global identifier that the text cursor (or selection) is on.</li>
    <li>When entering text a browser or other multiline textview, you can accept the text by pressing&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Enter&gt;. You can accept and typecheck the code at the same time by pressing&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Enter&gt;, and any type errors in the method will show up in a listbox right under the textview. Clicking on each type error will highlight where it occurs in the code. In single line textviews, &lt;Enter&gt; accepts the text. (Unfortunately, you can't enter typed code in Workspaces right now; the error display machinery currently needs to be in a method browser).</li>
    <li>&lt;Escape&gt; cancels text editing, and restores the text to its original value.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z is 'Undo' in text views. You can undo as many changes as you have made, back to the last accept. Redo is supported as well, but it is available only from the context menu.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E will scroll as necessary to make the input focus maximally _visible.</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">Normal Stuff</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Strongtalk is a real Windows application, with real Windows widgets embedded here and there, so most of the usual things work, such as &lt;Alt&gt; to get to the pull-down menus.</li>
    <li>&lt;Tab&gt; lets you traverse the hierarchy of widgets that will accept the input focus, and&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; works the same way in reverse. You can also use &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; and&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, which work even in text fields where Tab would change the text.</li>
    <li>The normal Windows cut/copy/paste keys work (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-X,&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C,&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V, respectively). They just manipulate text right now.</li>
    <li>Page-up and Page-down scroll the innermost scrollbars containing the input focus. So if there are multiple nested scrollbars, you can usually choose which one scrolls by moving the input focus around.</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">Executing Smalltalk Code</h4>
<ul>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-D performs a doIt on the current selection (executes the code). If nothing is explicitly selected, the default is intelligently chosen: from the beginning of the most recent line before the cursor that has no whitespace at the beginning of it, through the end of the line the cursor is on. In other words, you can execute a multi-line doIt without selecting it first, as long as the first line of the doIt starts at the left margin, subsequent lines have whitespace at the beginning, and the cursor is on the last line of the doit.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-I does an inspectIt on the current selection (executes the code and opens an inspector on the result). If nothing is explicitly selected, selection works the same as for doIt.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S does a showIt on the current selection (executes the code and prints the result in-line). If nothing is explicitly selected, selection works the same as for doIt. Unlike other Smalltalks, the result is not just text, even though it looks like it. It is an embedded object showing the printstring. Clicking on it will open an inspector.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-B converts the selection into a Button embedded in the text, which you can click on whenever you want to execute the code. A cool generalization of doIts.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F does a fileIn on the selection.</li>
