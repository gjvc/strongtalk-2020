        ... when Smalltalk hit the larger world, it was pretty much
        taken as "something just to be learned", as though it were
        Pascal or Algol.  Smalltalk-80 never really was mutated into
        the next better versions of OOP.  Given the current low state
        of programming in general, I think this is a real mistake.
