AUTHORS


    Lars Bak

        the VM wizard.


    Gilad Bracha

        wrote the typechecker, the reflective interface support, and mixins at
        the Smalltalk level.


    Steffen Grarup

        who worked not only on the VM, especially the garbage collector; but on
        the Smalltalk side, where he wrote the programming environment, as well as the
        source code manager and other things.


    Robert Griesemer

        wrote the interpreter, the interpreter generator, most of the compiler,
        and other VM stuff. (He also wrote an even better compiler than the one running
        in this version, but it wasn't quite finished enough for us to use for this
        release- it would have been considerably faster).


    David Griswold

        wrote the typed "Blue Book" libraries, and the glyph-based user-interface
        framework, the widgets and the HTML browser, and also managed the group.


    Urs HÃ¶lzle

        of course worked on the compiler and the tricky inlining infrastructure
        that it used, and other VM stuff.


    Srdjan Mitrovic

        joined and did most of the adaptation of the technology to Java.


    Stephen L. Rees


    George Cox

        Cleaned up the code to C++20 standard
