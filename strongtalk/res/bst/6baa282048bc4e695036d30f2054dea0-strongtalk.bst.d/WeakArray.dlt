comment: 
'Implements Arrays whose elements are checked by the garbage collector
to see if their memory would be reclaimed if they weren''t referenced by a
WeakArray.  This is called a ''near-death experience''.   The weak array is notified
whenever such a reference is detected by the collector, with the message
hadNearDeathExperience:.  By default, this message just nils out any
references to the object, so that it can be reclaimed on the next garbage
collection. 

Compatibility note:
This kind of WeakArray is not quite the same as the WeakArrays implemented
in some other Smalltalks.  Other WeakArrays implement ''post-facto'' notification,
which some company has patented.  Our WeakArrays actually are more flexible,
since they implement notification before-the-fact of object collection, so that
the contents of the object are still accessible.  For example, if this was used to
hold references to open file descriptors, upon notification, the file descriptor can
be closed, and then its reference nilled out so that it can be collected.  With
previous WeakArrays, the descriptor gets collected before you find out that it
was destroyed, so you have to keep the information needed to close the file
in some additional data structure.
