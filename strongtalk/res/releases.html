            Perfect typography depends on perfect harmony between all of its elements. 
            Harmony is determined by relationships

            True book design, therefore, is a matter of tact (tempo, rhythm,
            touch) alone. It flows from something rarely appreciated today:
            good taste. The book designer strives for perfection; yet every
            perfect thing lives somewhere in the neighborhood of dullness and
            is frequently mistaken for it by the insensitive. In a time that
            hungers for tangible novelties, dull perfection holds no
            advertising value at all.

            In a masterpiece of typography, the artist's signature has been
            eliminated. What some may praise as personal styles are in reality
            small and empty peculiarities, frequently damaging, that masquerade
            as innovations.

            Only through constant practice and strictest self-criticism may we
            develop a sense for a perfect piece of work. Unfortunately, most
            seem content with a middling performance. Careful spacing of words
            and the correct spacing of capital letters appear to be unknown or
            unimportant to some typesetters, yet for him who investigates, the
            correct rules are not difficult to discover.

          TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted;
          nor is it ever accidental. Indeed, beautifully typeset pages are always
          the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank of
          great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting stands apart from
          ex- pressive artwork, because the appeal is not limited to a small
          circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment, and nowhere does this
          judgment carry more weight. Typography that can- not be read by everybody
          is useless. Even for someone who constantly ponders matters of
          readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether
          something can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at
          once when the type is too small or otherwise irritates the eye; both are
          signs of a certain illegibility already.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
          All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a
          smoothly running sentence or as an assembly of lines, which may even have
          contrasting shapes. Good typog- raphy begins, and this is no minor
          matter, with the typeset- ting of a single line of text in a book or a
          newspaper. Using exactly the same typeface, it is possible to create either
          a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is too wide
          or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.

        Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information
        in writing.
        
      <p>No argument or consideration can absolve typography from this
        duty. A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without
        purpose.

        NOMENCLATURE

        This is Strongtalk-2020


        COMPILER
        RECOMPILER


        SOURCE FILES

        .dlt    "delta" files
        .gr     "group" files, used for denoting a group of .dlt files



        TYPE FEEDBACK

        RecompilationScope is the source for type feedback.


        PRIMTIIVES

        Primitives are like procedures (no dispatching is necessary) and invoked by providing a number of parameters.


        CODE GENERATION

        src/perl/primDefFilter
        generates prims.src file

        src/smalltalk/StrongtalkSource/DeltaPrimitiveGenerator.dlt
        reads prims.src file


        NON-LOCAL RETURNS


        CALLING CONVENTIONS

        "stdcall" / "Pascal" calling convention
        A routine that uses the Pascal calling convention must preserve EBX, EBP, ESI, EDI.
        (source Microsoft Development Library, MASM 6.1 Programmer's Guide)

        "cdecl" / "C" calling convention
        A routine that uses the C calling convention must preserve EBP, ESI, EDI.


        INLINE CACHING

        The goal of inline caching is to speed up runtime method binding by remembering
        the results of a previous method lookup directly at the call site.

        anamorphic,     // send has never been executed => no type information	(size = 0)
        monomorphic,    // only one receiver type available			(size = 1)
        polymorphic,    // more than one receiver type available		(size > 1)
        megamorphic     // many receiver types, only last one is available	(size = 1)


        Initially, a call site is considered to be in the "anamorphic" state.

        Once the language runtime reaches a particular uninitialized call site, it
        performs the dynamic lookup, stores the result at the call site and changes its
        state to "monomorphic".

        A "polymorphic" call site decides which of a limited set of known methods to
        invoke based on the type that it is currently presented with. In other words,
        with polymorphic inline caching, multiple method lookup results can be recorded
        at the same call site. 

        Because every call site in a program can potentially see every type in the
        system, there usually is an upper bound to how many lookup results are recorded
        at each call site.  Once that upper bound is reached, call sites become
        "megamorphic" and no more inline caching is performed.

        The abbreviations "MIC", "PIC" are used for MegamorphicInlineCache and PolymorphicInlineCache
        A MegamorphicInlineCache is also known as a "megamorphic PolymorphicInlineCache".



        MESSAGE SENDS

        Normal sends
        message sent to a selector on a receiver

        Super sends
        message sent to a selector on a super class of a receiver

        NATIVE METHODS

        NativeMethod objects are the compiled code versions of Delta methods.

        A NativeMethod consists of, in order:

        <ul class="list pl0">
          <li> header</li>
          <li>machine instructions (mostly in NCodeBase)</li>
          <li>oop location informatio	(in OopNativeCode)</li>
          <li>mapping from block_closure_index to NonInlinedBlockScope offset</li>
          <li>debugging information
          <li> dependency information
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="list pl0">

MEMORY ALLOCATION MODEL

All classes in the virtual machine must be subclassed by one of the following allocation classes:

"For objects allocated in the resource area."
- ResourceObject
- PrintableResourceObject

"For objects allocated in the C-heap (managed by: free & malloc)."
- CHeapAllocatedObject
- PrintableCHeapAllocatedObject

"For objects allocated on the stack."
- StackAllocatedObject
- PrintableStackAllocatedObject

"For embedded objects."
- ValueObject

"For classes used as name spaces."
- AllStatic

"The printable subclasses are used for debugging and define virtual
member functions for printing. Classes that avoid allocating the
vtbl entries in the objects should therefore not the printable subclasses"
