        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The VFX Reference Platform is a set of tool and library versions to be used as a common target platform for building software for the VFX industry. Its purpose is to minimise incompatibilities between different software packages, ease the support burden for Linux-based pipelines and encourage further adoption of Linux by software vendors. The Reference Platform is updated annually by a group of software vendors in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ves-committees?jump-9">Visual Effects Society Technology Committee</a>.</p>

        <h3>Current Status</h3>

	<p>The Calendar Year 2020 (CY2020) Reference Platform is the target for all major software releases in 2020.</p>

	<p><strong>7th March 2020</strong> -  CY2020 updated - Added required patch for Qt for Python (PySide) and an alternative option of using 5.13.</p>

	<p><strong>2nd November 2019</strong> -  Late change approved to CY2020 - OpenEXR updated to 2.4.x.</p>
	
	<p><strong>3rd August 2019</strong> -  The CY2020 Platform is now Final with no further changes planned.</p>

        <h3>Reference Platform</h3>

        <p>Each annual reference platform is designated by the calendar year in which major product releases should be targeting that particular reference.</p>

	<p>All versions should be considered exact required versions, except for those components where <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-sort" aria-hidden="true"></span> indicates that:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li>for systems (or software) providing the library at runtime, versions should be considered <em>minimum version required.</em></li>
	  <li>otherwise, for software building software against the library, versions should be considered <em>highest version allowed</em></li>
        </ul>

      <p>The move to Python 3 was delayed from CY2019 to CY2020 due to:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>No supported combination of Qt 5.6, Python 3 and PySide 2 so Qt first needed to be upgraded.</li>
	<li>Upgrade of both Qt and Python in the same year was too large a commitment for software vendors and large studios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python 3 in CY2020 is a firm commitment, it will be a required upgrade as Python 2 will no longer be supported beyond 2020. Software vendors are strongly encouraged to provide a tech preview release in 2019 to help studios with testing during their Python migration efforts.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <small>
      <p>UPDATED November 26th 2017 - CY2018 changed from gcc 5 to gcc 6 due to integration issues discovered with the older version. </p>
      <p>Redhat/CentOS systems can obtain gcc 6.3.1 by installing <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_toolset/6/html/6.1_release_notes/index">Redhat DTS 6.1</a>. To install Red Hat Developer Toolset 6.1 on CentOS 7:
        <pre><code>sudo yum -y install centos-release-scl
            sudo yum -y install devtoolset-6</pre></code></p>
      <p>If you are looking for gcc 6.3.1 source code then a copy can be found in <a href="http://vault.centos.org/7.5.1804/sclo/Source/rh/devtoolset-6/">the CentOS Vault</a>.</p>
      <p>Since gcc 5.1, libstdc++ <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html"> introduced a new library ABI</a> that includes new implementations of std::string and std::list. In order to maintain backwards compatibility the old implementations are still supported in parallel with the new ones. The choice of implementation is made using the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro, and the VFX Reference Platform is still using the older option so the compiler setting should be _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0. The Platform will move to the newer implementations in a future year once the major Linux distributions have made the transition. RHEL/CentOS 7 and Redhat DTS still use the original implementations by default.</p>

    <small>
      <p>The vanilla gcc 4.8.2 has a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58800">serious bug</a> that was fixed in 4.8.3 and some Linux distribution vendors actually ship a patched version as 4.8.2. The reason the Platform gave 4.8.2 as an option for CY2016 is that this gcc version is what ships with <a href="http://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/03/12/rh-dts2-1-ga/">Redhat Developer Toolset 2.1</a> that some software vendors werw committed to using through 2016.</p>
      <p>The following are the known distributions that ship with a fixed 4.8.2:- Redhat DTS 2.1, RHEL/CentOS 6.</p>
    </small>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default" id="footnote-qt">
  <div class="panel-heading"><small>Note - Qt modifications</small></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <small>
      <p>The major change for CY2016 was a move to Qt 5 which required a port of PySide and modifications to vanilla Qt. In November 2015 CY2016 version of Qt was upped from 5.5.x to 5.6.x with agreement from the community that it was preferable to align with a Long Term Support release. In May 2016 it was updated again to 5.6.1 to incorporate some critical bug fixes.</p>

      <p>These modifications are required to avoid the introduction of functional UI regressions impacting DCC tools and consist only of backported bug fixes and critical changes that have not yet been accepted into the mainline Qt distribution. The need for these modifications is not new, currently some software vendors ship their own differently modified Qt so CY2016 represented a significant step forward with the goal of all software vendors sharing an identically modified Qt. We are working with the Qt Company to eliminate the need for these modifications entirely in a future release, potentially as soon as CY2019.</p>
      
      <p>These Qt 5.6 modifications are available on Github from these forks of <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtbase/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtbase</a>, <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtx11extras/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtx11extras</a> and <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtdeclarative/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtdeclarative</a>. These modifications to <a href="http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.1/">Qt 5.6.1</a> should be used by anyone who wishes to build Qt applications against the Platforms from CY2016 through to CY2018. </p>
