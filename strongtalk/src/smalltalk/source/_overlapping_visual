Because this system allows intermixing of native and lightweight visuals, any composite visual that
wishes to overlap child visuals, in situations where an occluded child might contain native visuals,
must make sure the occluding children are native visuals.  This can be accomplished for lightweight
visuals by 'wrapping' them in an OverlappingVisual, which simply establishes a native window
for its single child.
