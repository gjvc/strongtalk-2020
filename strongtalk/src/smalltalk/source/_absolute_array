This class is like Array, except that it cannot have subclasses or subtypes.
This involves special treatment by the VM and the type system.  This information can
be used by the compiler to generate more efficient code.  You should ONLY use this
in situations where 
    1) polymorphism is completely unimportant
    2) absolutely maximum performance is needed.
