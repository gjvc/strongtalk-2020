Note: indexOf:[ifAbsent:] is here rather than in Indexed
so that Indexed can be contravariant on I.  The analogous
thing was not done for Dict because it was decided that the
richness of the key querying protocol was more important
than the contravariant flexibility, since now Indexed
can be used to get contravariant behavior on a limited
protocol for Dicts when needed.
