NAME            STones80
        AUTHOR          bruce@utafll.uta.edu (Bruce Samuelson)
        FUNCTION        low and medium level benchmarks for ST80 and ST/V
        ST-VERSIONS     all versions of ST80; portable to ST/V
        PREREQUISITES   need floating point hardware or emulation
        CONFLICTS       none
        DISTRIBUTION    world
        VERSION         1.0
        DATE            April 16, 1993

SUMMARY The filein includes two classes: Slopstones (Smalltalk Low level
OPeration Stones) and Smopstones (Smalltalk Medium level OPeration Stones).
Each includes seven cpu intensive benchmarks. They work equally well with
16-bit and 32-bit implementations and are designed to be portable to all
Smalltalk versions from ParcPlace and Digitalk. They are normalized to the
author's 486/33 Windows 3.1 machine running ParcPlace VisualWorks 1.0.
Results have been posted to the Usenet group comp.lang.smalltalk and form the
basis of an article that is scheduled to be published in the June issue of The
Smalltalk Report.

The only difference between the ST80 (STones80) and ST/V (STonesV) filein is
in the messages that define the classes in the first few lines of code. The
ST80 messages specify the class category and message protocol, which are not
used in ST/V.
