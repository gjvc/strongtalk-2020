Access to the raw structure of an ObjectiveC object.  Do not confuse this with ObjectiveCAlien, wich is a Smalltalk proxy for an ObjectiveC object.  
This is an indirect object (a struct, if you like); ObjectiveCAlien is a direct pointer to an object (a reference to an Objective-C object).

@interface Object
{
    Class isa;  /* A pointer to the instance's class structure */
}

Effectively:
struct objc_object {
    struct objc_class *isa;
};
