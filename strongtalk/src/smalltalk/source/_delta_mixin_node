This node is the root of a hierarchy representing the ASTs of mixins.
All these nodes are part of the type information. They should support a
protocol comparable to that of ClassIds, since they act as symbolic references
to mixins.

One should be able to obtain from such a node the physical mixin in question.
It is not quite clear thru what level of interface (mirrors etc.) that should go.
