This class is just for convenience when creating a standard type of 
KeyedSets, a KeyedSet of Associations, which is just like a Dictionary
except that the elements of the collection are the associations, not the
values.  A performance advantage of this kind of keyed set over a dictionary
is that you can change the value associated with any constant key much faster
than with #at:put: if you cache the association (but NEVER change the
key once you've put the association in the KeyedSet!!).

For example, if you have an AssocSet[Int,Str] and
you know you will be frequently setting the value associated with some
known key like 1024, you can do it by holding on to the association for 1024
and just sending it #value: whenever you need to change the value.  You
can't do this with a normal dictionary, because you can't get at the associations,
which are hidden inside the implementation.

KeyedSets and AssocSets are only marginally useful in a Smalltalk system because
there are already Set and Dictionary but a non-compatible Smalltalk or other
language whose goal was to be smaller and simpler than Smalltalk could use
the more general KeyedSet to replace both Set and Dictionary, so I have put
these classes in as examples.  If such a system was not statically typed, the
the convenience class AssocSet would not be needed.
