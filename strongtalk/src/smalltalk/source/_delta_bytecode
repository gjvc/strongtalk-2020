A temporary class needed for bootstrappingInProgress: In the virtual world, bytecode used to be
	stored as characters in the HCode, and character literals were stored as character 
	memOops. This works fine, but in the bootstrapped world one cannot distinguish between
	them!!
	We therefore now store bytecodes as instances of this class and character literals simply
	as themselves. See DeltaHCode>>holdsOopAt:.

	The correct solution would be to generate two separate arrays during compilation, one for
	bytecodes and another for oops, since this is required by the VM anyway.
	The conversion is currently done by Smalltalk>>createMethod:code:nofArgs:flags:debugInfo:
	and after the change this should be removed and the primitive called directly instead.
