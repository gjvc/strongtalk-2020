I represent a process running on the main thread of the OS process.
There should only ever be one active instance of me and it should be
created by the VM.

Actions may be scheduled to run on this thread by sending the message
#schedule: and passing a zero arg block as argument. Actions are
scheduled in FIFO order. Each runs to completion before the next is
scheduled.! !
