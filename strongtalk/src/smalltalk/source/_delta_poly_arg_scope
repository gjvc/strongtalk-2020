The sole purpose of this class is to allow us to distinguish between the
scopes used for type arguments in a polymorphic function and ordinary
scopes.

We need to make this distinction because:

1.  One needs to enforce the restriction that the names of the type arguments
of a polymorphic function are unique. However, type arguments can shadow
types in scopes surrounding the method. We need to able to determine which
entries are type arguments and which are not. Since type arguments inhabit
their own exclusive scopes, we can use these to make the distinction.
